# Here is the theme configuration file of Oneesan
#
# How to use:
#  - for creating a new theme, you need to create a new entry, and modifying the strings for your liking (IMPORTANT: You NEED to provide a string for all of the entries, or the themeloader will have a bad time.)
#  IMPORTANT: DO NOT delete the '%s' strings on the entry, Oneesan actually compute them with a String.format, if one '%s' is missing, the plugin will crash.
